# React + Vite

This project was created using Vite + React.

All functions work on both Sepolia and Mantatestnet.
The creation of TON memes is on Mainnet, but the tokens created on this network cannot be traded, this is planned to be implemented in the future.

The pool, poolfactory and router are custom Uniswap contracts, which have undergone minor modifications so that the platform can function correctly.
