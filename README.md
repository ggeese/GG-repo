# **Goldeng: The Future of Meme Coins**

Many people are venturing into the world of cryptocurrencies, drawn by the appeal of memes. However, many of these enthusiasts are new to crypto but have a deep love for memes, making them vulnerable to exploitation. This is where **Goldeng** steps in. Our mission is to make the entire process fast, simple, enjoyable, and safe.

### 🚀 **Easy Meme Creation**

At Goldeng, we simplify the creation of memecoins with just a few clicks, removing the usual complexities of launching a new token.

- **Trade Instantly**: Every time a meme is created, you can trade it without needing to provide liquidity.
- **Bot Protection**: We've implemented a security system to protect against bots. More on this in our [security documentation](#).

### ⚙️ **Smart Launch (Optional Feature)**

Our **Smart Launch** feature allows creators to launch memecoins with an initial **100% sell fee** that gradually decreases over a set period. This feature can be customized during token creation, enabling you to define how long the sell fee will reduce to 0%. For example, if a creator sets the duration to 2 hours, the sell fee will gradually decrease from 100% to 0% over that time frame.

- **Applies Only to Sell Transactions**: The fee only impacts selling, not buying.
- **Prevents Early Sales**: This mechanism helps prevent bots or early sellers from exploiting the token right after launch.
- **Customizable Duration**: You choose the time period during creation for how long the sell fee will decrease.

### 🎉 **Staking Rewards**

1% of the total supply of each token is allocated to staking rewards. This encourages a virtuous cycle, helping new tokens gather more holders and fostering a strong community from the start.

### 🏆 **Hall of Fame**

Some memes reach legendary status, and many people would love to own a virtual or physical version of their favorite meme.

- **DAO-Driven Initiative**: This area allows the community to create and receive physical meme collectibles.
- **Legal and Secure Payments**: To ensure compliance with legal requirements, we use **Coinbase** for payments. For countries with crypto restrictions, users can choose to receive their meme collectible in NFT format.
- **First Edition NFTs**: While there’s no max supply for these NFTs, the first 5000 will include a wallet containing a small amount of random memes.

---

### 💎 **Degen: Trade Memes from Day One**

For each token created:
- A liquidity pool is set up with **1 wei** and a small fraction of the new tokens, enabling trading from the get-go.
- 10% of the token supply is airdropped to a smart contract, with a minimum contribution of **0.0001 ETH**. This ETH is added to the liquidity pool, making it possible to trade memes with low liquidity but still enough to have fun.
