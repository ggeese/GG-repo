        <div className="space-y-2">
          <p><strong>At the beginning:</strong> <span className="text-yellow-600">(Goldeng)</span> is more than a meme. It is the meme, now is small and not well known, but it has a lot of potencial.</p>
          <p><strong>Hatching:</strong> As more people create memes(eggs) and the egg becomes famous, it hatches. Now we have more <span className="text-yellow-600">Goldengs</span>.</p>
          <p><strong>Shared Ownership:</strong> We all own a small part of all hatched eggs (1%). This is managed by the treasury.</p>
          <p><strong>Virtuous Circle:</strong> The treasury holds and gradually buys back <span className="text-yellow-600">Goldeng</span>, which increases its value. Additionally, you can earn more <span className="text-yellow-600">Goldeng</span> by staking it (like taking care of the egg to make it grow).</p>
          <p><strong>In short:</strong> <span className="text-yellow-600">Goldeng</span> is like a magic egg that grows when more people come together and take care of it. So join the virtuous circle and watch our golden eggs grow! üåüüê£</p>
